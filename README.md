# 🚢 AIS Data Science – THAS 2025  

This repository contains the implementation of the **Take-Home Assignment (THAS) 2025** for the *AI & Data Science Certificate Hohenheim (AIDAHO)*. It is part of the *Introduction to Data Science with R and RStudio* course (University of Hohenheim, Dr. Johannes Bleher). It focuses on analyzing and forecasting **Automatic Identification System (AIS) vessel data** using R, PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB, and Shiny.

## 📖 Project Overview  

The project is based on real AIS data (collected via Spire and the American Marine Cadastre Hub) stored in a **Kubernetes-hosted PostgreSQL database** with a PostgREST API interface.  

The main objectives are:  

1. **Explore and summarize AIS static and dynamic vessel data**  
2. **Sample and visualize vessel movements on interactive maps (Leaflet)**  
3. **Forecast vessel positions and evaluate prediction accuracy**  
4. **Develop dashboards and deploy a Shiny app via Docker + NGINX**  

Deliverables include R scripts, sampled data, visualizations, dashboards, and a final report.
